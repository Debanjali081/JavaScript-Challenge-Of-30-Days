// Task 8 : Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console .

let a=5;
let b='5';

let val1=(a==b)?true:false;
let val2=(a===b)?true:false;

console.log(`It(==) checks only the value so the result is ${val1}`)

console.log(`It(===) checks  the value as well as the type so the result is ${val2}`)
